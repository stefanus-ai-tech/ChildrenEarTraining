## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** The game initializes automatically when you open the `index.html` file.
2. **Listen to the Note:** Click the "Play Sound ðŸŽµ" button to hear a randomly generated musical note.
3. **Identify the Note:**  Choose the emoji button that you believe corresponds to the note you just heard.
4. **Check Your Answer:**
    *   **Correct Answer:** Your score will increase, and if you've reached the required number of successful guesses for the current level, you'll advance to the next level. A new note will be generated.
    *   **Incorrect Answer:** You'll lose a try. The correct note will be revealed briefly. You can click "Play Sound ðŸŽµ" again to re-hear the note.
5. **Level Up:** Successfully identify a certain number of notes at the current level to progress to the next level. Each level introduces a new note, increasing the difficulty.

## Game Mechanics

*   **Scoring:** You earn one point for each correctly identified note.
*   **Leveling Up:** You need to correctly identify 3 notes consecutively to advance to the next level. Each level introduces a new musical note option.
*   **Tries:** You start with 3 tries. An incorrect guess will deduct one try. The game ends when your tries reach zero.
*   **Note Generation:** The game randomly selects a note from the set of available notes for the current level.
*   **Emoji Representation:** Each musical note (C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4) is represented by a unique emoji for visual identification.

*   **Difficulty Settings:** Implement options to adjust the speed of level progression or the number of tries.
